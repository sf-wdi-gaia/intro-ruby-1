# Day 4

1. Scan through the [Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) to see some of the standards the pros follow (and insist on).  You don't have to read everything but take some time to get the basics.
2. Fill out the [project 2 peer feedback form](http://goo.gl/forms/ZN1fJi5rs0ugi5ki1).
2. Get some rest; don't work too late on the styleguide.

> Styleguides are used in the industry to specify certain ways of using a particular language that are deemed ideal.  Following styleguides makes your code more readable to other developers.  Many of the rules in styleguides have very specific intentions that will also help you avoid bugs.

> Don't worry about understanding the reasoning behind every styleguide rule now.  These will come to you in time as your skills and experience increase.


# Day 5

1. Create or update your [portfolio](./portfolio.md), and make sure it's deployed publicly online!
2. Prepare a [lightning talk](./lightning-talk.md) on a technology we haven't covered. (Think about a tool you might want to use in project 3!)
